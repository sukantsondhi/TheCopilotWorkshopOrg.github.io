Key policy: 20'000 extra police officers. Big concern around the ongoing support to young in service officers and how this is impacting quality of service. LLM to sit across key legislation, codes of practice and policy to enable officers to have the information at their fingertips to make good decisions and improve outcomes.

**Ministerial Correspondence**

Managing ministerial correspondence is a vital task for departments. Could a Generative AI tool automate triaging of correspondence, suggest responses based on departmental policies, detect trends around policy themes and concerns, and automate flagging of threats/vulnerabilities etc?

**Flood Modelling / Flood Response**

Generative AI could play a significant role in future flood response and planning by leveraging by improving flood prediction via early warning systems, simulating scenarios to model impact, and improving the effective allocation of resources.

**Career Progression**

Generative AI has the potential to offer valuable support in the career development of civil servants. Could it provide personalized recommendations, such as identifying suitable mentors, suggesting relevant networking events, and guiding individuals toward communities aligned with their career aspirations. Is there a role that GenAI can play in upskilling workforce.Procurement aggregation -  The variation in the way things are described makes it very difficult at a Public Sector level to get a holistic view of where common goods and services are being procured individually, as opposed to being aggregated to benefit from bulk purchasing. AI, with an LLM attuned to commercial language, could regularly process multiple sources of procurement information looking for trends and patterns that would be candidate for aggregation.

**Commercial best practice**

Everyday hundreds of new contracts are being drafted and agreed. Could GenAI be used to help improve the processes? CDDO

**Customer Call Efficiency**

Millions of taxpayers each year contact the department on the phone for various reasons, for example changing their tax code due to change of circumstances. Each of these calls goes through identity validation checks and a transcription of the call is captured. Once the customer has been helped, the advisor spends a few minutes making a summary of the call so that if the customer calls back, another advisor can quickly see the history. Currently, this call summarisation is a manual task.  Quality assurance, checking whether advisors have followed correct protocol on calls, is also a manual check done by managers post call where they select random transcriptions to QA. Our assumption that we’d like to test, is whether generative AI can be used in conjunction with the call transcriptions (post call) to create a call summary, check whether the advisor has followed expected call protocols, and provide sentiment analysis, providing an effective call “wrap-up” service. Could it have guardrails to ensure accuracy of the GenAI output, for example to detect hallucinations. Will it accurately summarise the call, noting down sentiment automatically of the customer?  A separate challenge is that on certain calls the Welsh language could be requested on correspondence, and the call advisors have to send them to a translation unit, which does this clerically, which will take additional time. Could GenAI hit 100% Welsh translation accuracy, maintaining the form layout etc.
